# CAHOOTS Dispatch Analysis  
*DSCI 410 - Applied Data Science for Social Justice*

## Overview  

This project evaluates how Eugene’s mobile-crisis program **CAHOOTS** (Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets) has altered 911 call-handling patterns-especially after a major capacity expansion on **1 Jan 2017** (second van + 03:00–10:00 coverage).  
We analyse eleven years of Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) records (2014 – 2025) to answer:

1. **RQ-1:** What proportion of total 911 calls does each agency handle (CAHOOTS vs. Police), and how has that share changed over time?  
2. **RQ-2:** Within the early-morning window (03:00 – 10:00)-directly affected by the 2017 expansion-how have diversion rates from police to CAHOOTS evolved?

## Data  

| Source | Coverage | Key Fields | Notes |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| City of Eugene Police Department (public-records request) | 1 Jan 2014 – 5 Jun 2025, **1.49 M** calls | `calltime`, `nature`, `primeunit`, `priority`, `zip` | Missing/ambiguous `primeunit` codes (~3 %); free-text `nature` variants |
| CAHOOTS unit list | Derived (1J77, 3J79, “CAHOOT”, etc.) | - | Used for regex classification into **CAHOOTS / NOT CAHOOTS / unknown** |

---

## Methodology  

### 1 . Data Preparation  

* Concatenate 12 annual CSVs → `master_df`  
* Parse `calltime` → datetime; derive `date`, `hour`, `year`, `month`  
* Classify responder via regex on `primeunit`; drop `unknown` rows  
* Clean `nature` strings (strip “, CAHOOTS”, merge variants)  
* Flag:  
  * `post_expansion` (≥ 2017-01-01 05:00)  
  * `early_window` (03:00 ≤ hour < 10:00)  

### 2 . Analysis Pipeline (`v1.ipynb`)  

| Step | Operation | Output |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Daily volumes | Group by `date × Unit Type`; 7-day rolling mean | **Figure 1** |
| 24-month panels | Loop over consecutive-year pairs | **Figures 2a – 2k** |
| Early-window focus | Filter `early_window`; daily and paired panels | **Figures 3 + 4a – 4k** |
| Pre/Post summary | Compare 2014-16 vs 2017-24 means | **Figures 5a-c** |
| Dominance streaks | ≥ 50.1 % CAHOOTS share (early window) | **Figure 6**, streak metrics |
| Incident patterns | Core natures bar, share-over-time lines, annual pies & treemaps | **Figures 7 – 11** |

All visuals are regenerated by running the notebook top-to-bottom.

## Key Findings (Visual-Only Summary)  

* CAHOOTS’ share of 03:00–10:00 calls jumps from **≈ 30 %** to **≈ 83 %** immediately after the 2017 expansion and remains > 70 % through 2025.  
* Police daily volume stays flat post-expansion, indicating true diversion.  
* Ten sustained “dominance” streaks occur; the longest spans **2 263 days**.  
* Incident mix is stable (Public Assist, Welfare Check dominate) but CAHOOTS’ share within most categories grows.

## Repository Structure  

.
├─ data/                   # raw CSVs (not included in public repo)
├─ figures/                # PNG/SVG images generated by the notebook
├─ v1.ipynb                # end-to-end analysis & visualisation
├─ report.pdf              # final written report (exported from notebook)
├─ environment.yml         # reproducible conda environment
└─ README.md               # this file

## Reproducing the Analysis  

1. **Clone** the repo  
2. Create the conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate cahoots-env

	3.	Place the raw CAD CSVs in data/ (file list in data/README.md).
	4.	Open v1.ipynb and run all cells.
Figures and report.pdf will regenerate in figures/.
